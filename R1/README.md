Custom arduino:
-------------------
This is a custom Arduino whit some extra features and while some of them are unnecessary some can be helpfull for quick deployment of soultions and reducing wires while prototyping.
This project is completly open source and the only thing I ask for is feedback.

Repository Contents:
-------------------
* **EasyEDA** - Sopurce files (schematic and PCB).
* **FabFiles** - Fabrication files for the R1.
* **imgs** - Images of the board.
