**R2 Changes and fixes:**
 - Adding a data out pin for the neopixel to allow for pixel chaining with a built in pin (PXout).
 - New pin arrangment to fix empty pins and odd arrangment of the R1.
 - Check for issues and fix silk layer.
 - Adding a switch to toggle data input to the neoopixel and allow for switching between standard pin use and neopixel use.
 - Replacing some components for ones with better performance or availability, both for [SMT](https://jlcpcb.com/parts) and [order](https://lcsc.com/).
These components have been discontinued by LCSC.com, however they're available trough [JLCPCB SMT](https://jlcpcb.com/parts) extended parts, for better support all parts used should be available and in stock both in LCSC and JLCPCB, the ones below are some parts that must be replaced for better availability:
